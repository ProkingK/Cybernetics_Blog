                <p class="intro-explaintion">
                    Cybernetics is the study of the control and communication systems in living 
                    organisms and machines. It is a field that combines engineering, biology, 
                    computer science, and other disciplines to understand how systems process 
                    information and make decisions. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="intro-explaintion">
                    At its core, cybernetics is concerned with understanding how systems function 
                    and how they can be controlled and maintained. This includes both natural and 
                    artificial systems, such as the human body and its various systems 
                    (e.g. circulatory, respiratory), as well as technological systems like 
                    computers and robots.
                </p>
                
                <p class="intro-explaintion">
                    The goal of cybernetics is to understand how systems can be designed and 
                    optimized to work more effectively, whether they are biological or technological 
                    in nature. It is a broad field that has applications in a variety of fields, 
                    including healthcare, robotics, and computer science.
